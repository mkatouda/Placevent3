Placevent - 3D-RISM-based solvent and ion placement software created by Daniel Sindhikara, sindhikara@gmail.com
Placevent
This program is designed to automatically place explicit solvent atoms/ions based
on 3D-RISM data. Placevent is compatible with AMBER .dx files and MDF .h5 files.

The details of the algorithm are described in: 
Placevent: An algorithm for prediction of explicit solvent atom distribution -- Awpplication to HIV-1 protease and F-ATP synthase
